      <h2 class="text-justify">Chandragupta Maurya</h2>
      <p class="para text-justify">
        Chandragupta Maurya (reigned c.320 BCE c. 298 BCE) was the
        founder and the first emperor of the Maurya Empire, based in Magadha
        (present-day Bihar) in the Indian subcontinent. His rise to power began
        in the period of unrest and local warfare that arose after Alexander the
        Great's Indian campaign and early death in 323 BCE, although the exact
        chronology and sequence of events remains subject to debate among
        historians. He started a war against the unpopular Nanda dynasty in
        Magadha on the Ganges Valley, defeated them and established his own
        dynasty. <img class="Ashoka" src="./img/card images/chandragupta Maurya.webp" alt=""> In addition, he raised an army to resist the
        Greeks, defeated them, and took control of the eastern Indus
        Valley. His conquest of Magadha is generally dated to 322–319
        BCE and his expansion to Punjab subsequently at c. 317–312
        BCE, but some scholars have speculated that he might have initially
        consolidated his power base in Punjab, before conquering Magadha an
        alternative chronology places these events all in the period c. 311–305
        BCE. According to the play Mudrarakshasa, Chandragupta was
        assisted by his mentor Chanakya, who later became his minister. He
        expanded his reach subsequently into parts of the western Indus
        Valley and possibly eastern Afghanistan through a dynastic
        marriage alliance with Seleucus I Nicator  305–303 BCE. His empire
        also included Gujarat and a geographically extensive network of
        cities and trade-routes. There are no historical facts about
        Chandragupta's origins and early life, only legends, while the narrative
        of his reign is mainly deduced from a few fragments in Greek and Roman
        sources, and a few Indian religious texts, all written centuries after
        his death. The prevailing levels of technology and infrastructure
        limited the extent of Chandragupta's rule and the administration was
        decentralised, with provinces and local governments and large
        autonomous regions within its limits. Chandragupta's reign, and the
        Maurya Empire, which reached its peak under his grandson Ashoka the
        Great began an era of economic prosperity, reforms, infrastructure
        expansions. Buddhism, Jainism and Ājīvika prevailed over the
        non-Maghadian Vedic and Brahmanistic traditions, initiating, under
        Ashoka, the expansion of Buddhism, and the synthesis of Brahmanic and
        non-Brahmanic religious traditions which converged in Hinduism. His
        legend still inspires visions of an undivided Indian nation.
