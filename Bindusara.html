            <h2>Samrat Bindusara</h2>
            <p class="para text-justify">
                Bindusara (r. c. 297 – c. 273 BCE) was the second Mauryan emperor of Magadha in Ancient India. The
                ancient Greco-Roman writers called him Amitrochates, a name likely derived from his Sanskrit title
                Amitraghāta ("slayer of enemies").

                Bindusara was the son of the dynasty's founder Chandragupta and the father of its most famous ruler
                Ashoka. His life is not documented as well as the lives of these two emperors. Much of the
                information about him comes from legendary accounts written several hundred years after his death.
                Bindusara consolidated the empire created by his father.

                The 16th century Tibetan Buddhist author Taranatha credits his administration with extensive
                territorial conquests in southern India, but some historians doubt the historical authenticity of
                this claim.

                <h2>Legend of His Birth</h2>
                <p class="para text-justify">
                    The legend of Bindusara’s birth, as mentioned in both Buddhist and Jain texts, tells us that
                    Chanakya, the minister of Chandragupta Maurya, used to mix small doses of poison in the
                    emperor’s food to build his immunity against possible poisoning attempts, but one day,
                    Chandragupta shared his food with his pregnant wife, who was seven days away from delivery,
                    leading to the queen’s death. Soon Chanakya intervened to save the unborn child, and with this,
                    Bindusara was born. In the Buddhist account (Mahavamsa and Mahavamsa Tikka), Chanakya cut off
                    the empress’s head and cut open her belly with a sword to take out the foetus, placing it in the
                    belly of a goat freshly killed each day for seven days. The child was then born with drops of
                    goat’s blood on his body, leading to the name Bindusara. In the Jain text Parishishta-Parvan,
                    Chanakya entered the room the moment the empress collapsed and cut open her womb to take out the
                    baby. A drop of poison had already reached the baby, touching its head, leading to the name
                    Bindusara, meaning “the strength of the drop.”.
