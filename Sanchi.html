            <h2>Sanchi stupa</h2>
            <p class="para text-justify">
                Sanchi Stupa is a Buddhist complex, famous for its Great Stupa, on a hilltop at Sanchi Town in Raisen
                District of the State of Madhya Pradesh, India. It is located, about 23 kilometers from Raisen town, the
                district headquarter and 46 kilometres north-east of Bhopal, capital of Madhya Pradesh. <img

                The Great Stupa at Sanchi is one of the oldest stone structures in India, and an important monument to
                the historical architecture of India.It was originally commissioned by the Mauryan emperor Ashoka in
                the 3rd century BCE. Its nucleus was a simple hemispherical brick structure built over the relics of the
                Buddha. It was crowned by the chatra, a parasol-like structure symbolising high rank, which was intended
                to honour and shelter the relics. The original construction work of this stupa was overseen by Ashoka,
                whose wife Devi was the daughter of a merchant of nearby Vidisha. Sanchi was also her birthplace as well
                as the venue of her and Ashoka's wedding. In the 1st century BCE, four elaborately carved toranas
                (ornamental gateways) and a balustrade encircling the entire structure were added. The stupa at Sanchi
                built during the Mauryan period was made of bricks. The composite flourished until the 11th
                century.

                Sanchi is the center of a region with a number of stupas, all within a few miles of Sanchi, including
                Satdhara (9 km to the W of Sanchi, 40 stupas, the Relics of Sariputra and Mahamoggallana, now enshrined
                in the new Vihara, were unearthed there), Bhojpur (also called Morel Khurd, a fortified hilltop with 60
                stupas) and Andher (respectively 11 km and 17 km SE of Sanchi), as well as Sonari (10 km SW of
                Sanchi). Further south, about 100 km away, is Saru Maru. Bharhut is 300 km to the northeast.

                The "Great Stupa" at Sanchi is the oldest structure and was originally commissioned by the emperor
                Ashoka the Great of the Maurya Empire in the 3rd century BCE. Its nucleus was a hemispherical brick
                structure built over the sacred relics of the Buddha, with a raised terrace encompassing its base,
                and a railing and stone umbrella on the summit, the chatra, a parasol-like structure symbolizing high
                rank. The original Stupa only had about half the diameter of today's stupa, which is the result of
                enlargement by the Shungas. It was covered in brick, in contrast to the stones that now cover it.

                According to one version of the Mahavamsa, the Buddhist chronicle of Sri Lanka, Ashoka was closely
                connected to the region of Sanchi. When he was heir-apparent and was journeying as Viceroy to Ujjain, he
                is said to have halted at Vidisha (10 kilometers from Sanchi), and there married the daughter of a local
                banker. She was called Devi and later gave Ashoka two sons, Ujjeniya and Mahendra, and a daughter
                Sanghamitta. After Ashoka's accession, Mahendra headed a Buddhist mission, sent probably under the
                auspices of the Emperor, to Sri Lanka, and that before setting out to the island he visited his mother
                at Chetiyagiri near Vidisa, thought to be Sanchi. He was lodged there in a sumptuous vihara or
                monastery, which she herself is said to have had erected.</p>

                by Percy Brown (center). It is very similar to the Lion Capital of Ashoka at Sarnath, except for the
                abacus, here adorned with flame palmettes and facing geese, 250 BCE. Sanchi Archaeological Museum. <img class="margin" src="./img/card images/pillar.jpg" alt="">
                To the right: depiction of the four lions capital surmounted by a Wheel of Law at Sanchi, Satavahana
                period, 1st century CE, South gateway of stupa 3.
                A pillar of finely polished sandstone, one of the Pillars of Ashoka, was also erected on the side of the
                main Torana gateway. The bottom part of the pillar still stands. The upper parts of the pillar are at
                the nearby Sanchi Archaeological Museum. The capital consists in four lions, which probably supported a
                Wheel of Law as also suggested by later illustrations among the Sanchi reliefs. The pillar has an
                Ashokan inscription and an inscription in the ornamental Sankha Lipi from the Gupta
                period. The Ashokan inscription is engraved in early Brahmi characters. It is unfortunately much
                damaged, but the commands it contains appear to be the same as those recorded in the Sarnath and
                Kausambi edicts, which together form the three known instances of Ashoka's "Schism Edict". It relates to
                the penalties for schism in the Buddhist sangha:
